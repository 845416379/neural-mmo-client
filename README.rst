########################

This repository contains the Unity3D client for the main `[Neural MMO] <https://github.com/jsuarez5341/neural-mmo>`_ project. You should expect 50-60 FPS on a high end desktop. It's written in C# in a manner accessible to researchers and developers who work primarily in Python.

#############################

I, Joseph Suarez, am the author of the Unity Client. It is available under the MIT license.

The THREE.js Legacy Web Client was created in collaboration with Clare Zhu. It was originally created as follow-up work for the paper and blog post, but we ended up merging it in. This is also the reason that the project is split into two repositories. It is also available under the MIT license.
